# Arrays Part 2

to create an array that's empty, you can use the following approaches

1. Just BRACKETS: (php version > 5.4)
```
$arrayNameVariable = [];
```

2. A FUNCTION. In orevious versions of php (in php version <= 5.4) you can use the array() function like so:

```
$arrayNameVariable = array();
```

## EXAPLES
1. with brackets
```
$arrA = ["first value","second","abc","Yes please!!!"];
```
2. As a function
$arrA = array("first value","second","abc","Yes please!!!");
```

Both examples do the exact same thing: a array variable with the 3 options.

```
# TASK:

* Create 1 array with values from 3 to 10, in both ways;
You can do this manually, no need for a loop or a function use.
