# Array Sort

You have the following array:

```$arrx = [1,5,2,9,7,4,10,11,3,6,8];```

**TASK**

Find a way to turn that into 

```[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]```

Basically, you have to sort the array contents.

**You don't have to output anything and show on the screen. Just have $arrx be sorted like above.**

Good luck!
