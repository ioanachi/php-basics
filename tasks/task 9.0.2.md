# Reverse order of arrays

You have the following array:

```$characters = ['a','b','c','d','x','y','This should be first'];```

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to show on the screen, the contents of the array, reversed, with a delimiter of ```/```. 
Ex:
```This Should be first/y/x/d/c/b/a```
