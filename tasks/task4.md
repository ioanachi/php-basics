# Comment previous tasks and Multiline Comments concept

So far, you learnt that coments are made with //

Everything that goes after that is ignored by PHP. Comments are for the programmer to understand the code. 

There are other ways to comment. One is using the # sign. Ex:
```# this is a comment```

### Multiple lines comments

In the scenario where you have a big chunc of code that you want to comment you may use this example:
```
/*

I am commenting multiple lines here
That is right
All of this is commented
Notice how I start the comments with /* and everything after that is commented,and Then I end the commented code/text with */ after that things are not commented anymore 

*/
```

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to add comments (one line before each piece of code that needs an explanation) task1.php, task2.php, task3.php and task4.php So that when you return and look at the files, everything is explained.

As an example, I will comment array.php in my next commit. Open that file and see how it looks like

**Note** IF you will look at the file locally on your computer, be sure to ``` git pull``` first so that the changes I made on github will reflect in your local enviroment
