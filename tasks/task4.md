#Dynamic Select

You remember the select html Field:

``` <select name="my-select">```
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```<option value="1">First Value</option>```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```	<option value="2">Second Value</option>```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```<option value="3">Whatever</option>```
```</select>```

Use te knowledge you gained in the task inside the file integrarihtmlsiphp.php and do the following:

###Generate a select from a array. 

Actually, generate the above select from an array in PHP

* Create an array with 3 string values (eg: First Value, Second Value, Whatever)
* Create the select HTML (with no options)
* Create a loop that cycles trough the array (PHP code that will go inside of the select tags
* Inside of the loop, write 1 option (that option will repeat how many times the loop is programmed to repeat)
* The value of the option can be left empty but the Text inside of the option will be the array value for each loop iteration. (eg, for the first time the while runs the contents of the option will be ```First Option```)
**[The first loop with output something like the following example]:** ```<option>First Option</option>``` 

In the end The result will be the begining of the task select html code. Only thing is, it will be made dynamically, from an array, with PHP.

Good luck! Feel free to ask ANYTHING that you did not understand in the requirement.
