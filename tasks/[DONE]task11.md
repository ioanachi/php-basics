# Reverse order of arrays

You have the following array:

```$characters = ['a','b','c','d','x','y','lalala','a','b','c','d','x','y','lalala','a','b','c','d','x','y','lalala'];```

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to show on the screen, the contents of the array, reversed, with a delimiter of ```/```. 

Exemple of what your output should be:

```lalala/y/x/d/c/b/a/lalala/y/x/d/c/b/a/lalala/y/x/d/c/b/a```

**NOTE** You must NOT do this manually (you must not change the values manually). Make a dynamic way of reorganizing the code. Hint: Use a loop to cycle between the values of the array and show them.
