<?php 
/*Arrays Part 2

to create an array that's empty, you can use the following approaches

Just BRACKETS: (php version > 5.4)
$arrayNameVariable = [];
A FUNCTION. In orevious versions of php (in php version <= 5.4) you can use the array() function like so:
$arrayNameVariable = array();
EXAPLES

with brackets
$arrA = ["first value","second","abc","Yes please!!!"];
As a function $arrA = array("first value","second","abc","Yes please!!!");

Both examples do the exact same thing: a array variable with the 3 options.

TASK:

Create 1 array with values from 3 to 10, in both ways; You can do this manually, no need for a loop or a function use.
*/
$arrA = [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];

$arrA =  array(3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10);
